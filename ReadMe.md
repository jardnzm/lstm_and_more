an example of lstm with projection.


with layer norm.


use the mean over all hidden state as the output of the entire sequence. 

overall architecture is lstmp -> linear -> relu

This toy example is build on this example: [https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning/tree/master/encoder](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning/tree/master/encoder)
